# UiPath Basics – For Each Loop with If Condition

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to combine a **For Each** loop with an **If condition** in UiPath.  
It is designed as a beginner practice task to understand decision making while iterating through a collection.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Iterate through an integer array using **For Each**
- Apply conditional logic inside a loop
- Understand how loop variables work in UiPath

---

## 🧩 Workflow Description
1. An integer array variable named `numbers` is created.
2. The array contains the values: `10, 20, 30, 40, 50`.
3. A **For Each** activity loops through each number.
4. Inside the loop, an **If** condition checks whether the current number is greater than 25.
5. Based on the condition:
   - If true → Displays **"High value"**
   - Else → Displays **"Low value"**

## 📂 Variables Used
| Variable Name | Type    | Description                          |
|--------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| numbers      | Int32[] | Stores a list of integer values      |

> Note: The loop variable `currentNumber` is automatically generated by the **For Each** activity.

Low value (10)
Low value (20)
High value (30)
High value (40)
High value (50)
